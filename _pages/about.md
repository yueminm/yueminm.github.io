I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a>, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://ichnow.ski/">Jeffrey Ichnowski</a>. My research focuses on leveraging **acoustic (vibro-tactile) sensing** to enhance performance in **dynamic** and **contact-rich** manipulation tasks.

I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University in 2023. During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to work with Prof. <a href="https://mtmason.com/">Matthew T. Mason</a> on extrinsic dexterous manipulation, an experience that motivated me to push the boundaries of robotic manipulation through a deeper understanding of physics and dynamics.
